# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Portfolio & Home SOC Lab Projects

### "Practical Experience in Incident Response, Threat Detection, and Security Operations."

---

Welcome!  
This repository is the central hub for my technical cybersecurity portfolio. Here you'll find my interactive portfolio website and comprehensive documentation for my hands-on Home SOC (Security Operations Center) Lab projects. Each project demonstrates end-to-end incident response workflows, real-world threat simulations, and practical problem-solving skills sought after in SOC Analyst roles.
